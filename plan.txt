Plan to follow

Clients:
  Download:
    Create a socket
    Request a download from the Server
    Receive a list of IPs
    Loop through the IPs till we receive the file

  List:
    Display the list of files
    Implementation upto whoever is writing this code

  Upload:
    Create a socket
    Loop:
      Request an upload from the Server
      Receive an IP
      Request an upload to the IP
      Check for confirmation by IP
      Send file
      Check for confirmation of upload/ error if sent by the IP
      Exit on confirm upload
      Loop again on failure


Storage(Download refers to how the download request will be handled and similarly)
  Download:
    Search for the file
    Send the file to Client or send file not found error and likewise for other errors

  Upload:
    Handle_upload:
      Receive the auth data from the Client
      Send Ack for confirmation to start upload
      Receive the file
      If Error
        Delete the file if created
        Send error in case of error
      Else 
        Send OK response

    Inform Server:
      Create Socket
      Send a request to server informing of successful file upload
      Close socket

  Copy:
    Start Client like upload(Skipping steps here)
    Get IP from Server
    Send file  along with auth data of the Client and not the Storage
    Handle similarly

Server
